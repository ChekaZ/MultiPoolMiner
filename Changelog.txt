- Added 'poolbalancesdata' to web API
- Added parameter '-PoolBalancesUpdateInterval', see README for details
- Added separate section 'Wallets' in config file; BTC/Wallet gets automatically moved to 'Wallets' on start

- Changed exchange rate currency name to be displayed in upper case
- Changed defaults parameter values for fresh installations; enabled 'CreateMinerInstancePerDeviceModel' and 'UseDeviceNameForStatsFileNaming' in config file

'UseDeviceNameForStatsFileNaming' in config file
- Changed start batch files; 'UseFastestMinerPerAlgoOnly' is now enabled by default

- Fixed 'No pools available' message when no wallet was explicitly configured in the config file
- Fixed donation addresses
- Fixed error displaying Pool balances, but no wallet address / username was configured
- Fixed MPM error message when '-MinerName' was empty
- Fixed MPM starts mining if only one miner is available
- Fixed pool balances display formatting (comma as decimal separator caused formatting issues)

- Fixed web dashboard balances summary, no not list -------- & ======== entries

- Improved handling of failed miners; they will get detected sooner

- Pool fee is now part of the profitability calculation

- Updated README: NiceHash pool configuration details

#### Miner changes

### Changes since 3.0.1a

#### New features
- Added algo CryptonightV8 to Start.bat
- Added '-CreateMinerInstancePerDeviceModel' switch is supported by all miners (see readme). This also fixes https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/2192
- Added '-UseDeviceNameForBenchmarkFileNaming' switch for alternate naming scheme for benchmark files (see readme)
- Added 'ProfitPenaltyFactor' to correct overoptimistic pool estimates (see readme)
- Added 'Start_all_Pools_all_Algos.bat' (not recommend for daily use, mining all algos/pools will reduce profitability)

- Changed benchmarking loop interval duration. A minimum of 10 hashrate samples must be gathered per interval (https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/2026)
- MPM makes miner and pool fees part of the profitability calculation. Added '-IgnoreFees' switch for more exact profit predictions (see readme).
- Changed Less miner debug output when miner windows are shown ('-ShowMinerWindow=$true'). MPM will print debug messages only for a miner running benchmarks.
- Changed all miner names as discussed in (https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/1931) and (https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/2199#issuecomment-430960331). 
_Note:This will trigger re-benchmarking of all algorithms!_

#### Enhancements
- Auto-reformat $Config.Region (will be set to what Get-Region returns)

- Improved API with more up to date information for running & failed miners
- Improved detection of failed miners (this also fixes https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/1968 & https://github.com/MultiPoolMiner/MultiPoolMiner/issues/1451) 
- Improved pool API request handling to fix 'Pool failed messages'

- Made $Config.DeviceName dynamic, if config changes it will get applied on next run

- MultiPoolMiner.ps1, allow for partially configured $Config.Pools entries. Required config items in $Config.Pools.[PoolName] (e.g. 'BTC') will inherit default values.

- Pool balance queries are less likely to fail (try 3 times before giving up)
- Pool files print message if no wallet address is available

- Support for multiple MPM instances (Note: Each instance needs to be installed in a separate directory. Note: Do not share the GPUs between instances!)

#### Removed miners
- PalginNvidia

- Temporarily removed FireIce XmrStak [AMD only] - Support for version 2.5.1 will be re-added soon

- Enhancement CPU-Cryply*, created separate instances per CPU feature set
- Enhancement CPU-Cryply*, miner will only be run if the required CPU feature set is present (requires CpuFeatureDetector.exe)
- Enhancement CPU-JayDee*, miner will only be run if the required CPU feature set is present (requires CpuFeatureDetector.exe)
- Enhancement CPU-Tprovot*, miner will only be run if the required CPU feature set is present (requires CpuFeatureDetector.exe)

- Enhancement Excavator & ExcavatorHNMP will close when no longer needed
- Enhancement for miners that have CUDA 9.2 AND 10.0 versions, MPM will download the matching version

- Fixed NVIDIA-CcminerKlaust_v8.23-modr1, disabled broken algo 'Neoscrypt'
- Fixed NVIDIA-CcminerPigeonCoin; fixed polytimos algorithm
- Fixed NVIDIA-CcminerTpruvot_v2.3,  monero is not an algo, map monero to CryptonightV7

#### Pool changes
- Added NLPool
- Added regions to Zpool (North America 'na' - Europe 'eu' - South East Asia 'sea')
- Added region 'eu' to BlockMaster 
- Added 'PayoutScheme' property to pools ("PPS" & "PPLNS")

- Fixed Pool Balance query, it failed when the pool file for the same pool did not exist and no wallet information was configured in $Config.Pools.[PoolName]

- Improved profit switching (pools with PPS payout scheme (e.g. NiceHash) always have SwitchingPrevention=1)

- Removed Zergpool (pool is closed)

- Zpool API requests go now over https

#### New algorithms
- BCD (BitCoinDiamond)
- Bitcash
- Cryptonight V8 variants
- Cuckoo
- Exosis
- Lbk3 (CryptoDredge), used to mine Vertical VTL
- X22i (algo is not yet available on any MPM included pools)

#### Other changes
- Enabled donations for NVIDIA-Ewbf, NVIDIA-Ewbf2 and NVIDIA-BMiner (seems to be unfair stripping donations on a donation based project, furthermore disabling donation has a negative impact on miner speed)

- Fixed downloader (failed to process archives containing subdirectories)

- Reduced benchmarking interval for X16r from 10 to 5 times interval

- Removed PWSH update in start bat files
